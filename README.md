# ⛽ Fuel Fraud Detection System (Full Stack + ML + Hardware)

## 📌 Overview
Fuel Fraud Detection System is an end-to-end solution that combines a hardware sensing device, a machine learning layer, and a full-stack web application to detect fuel theft, quantity manipulation, and abnormal fuel usage in real time. The system ensures transparency, accuracy, and fraud prevention in fuel distribution and monitoring.

## 🚀 Features
- Hardware-based fuel data collection (sensors / IoT device)
- Real-time fuel quantity monitoring
- Machine Learning–based fraud and anomaly detection
- Full-stack web dashboard for visualization and control
- Secure backend communication between hardware, ML, and frontend
- Scalable architecture for real-world deployment

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Hardware: Fuel level sensors / IoT device (e.g., Arduino / ESP32)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Machine Learning: Python
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Charts & analytics dashboard
- Environment Management: `.env`, `venv`


## 🧩 System Architecture
- Hardware device collects real-time fuel data
- Data is sent to the backend server
- Python ML model analyzes patterns and detects fraud
- Backend processes and stores results
- Frontend dashboard displays insights and alerts

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Fuel sensor captures live fuel measurements
2. Hardware sends data to the backend server
3. Backend triggers ML model for fraud detection
4. Anomalies and fraud events are identified
5. Results are visualized on the web dashboard
